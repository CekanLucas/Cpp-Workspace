/**

Use a `static` data member `annualInterestRate` to store the
annual interest rate for each of the savers

Each member of the class contains a `private` data member `savingsBalance`
indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit


Write a driver program to test class `SavingsAccount`

Instantiate two different objects of class SavingsAccount , saver1 and saver2 , with balances of
$2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set the
`annualInterestRate` to 3 percent

Then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for each of the savers.
Then set the `annualInterestRate` to 4 percent,
calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for each of the savers */

calculates the monthly interest by multiplying the
`savingsBalance` by `annualInterestRate` divided by 12;
