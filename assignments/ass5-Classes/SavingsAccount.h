/**
9.20 ( `SavingsAccount` Class)
Create a `SavingsAccount` class

Use a `static` data member `annualInterestRate` to store the
annual interest rate for each of the savers

Each member of the class contains a `private` data member `savingsBalance`
indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit

Provide member function `calculateMonthlyInterest` that
calculates the monthly interest by multiplying the
`savingsBalance` by `annualInterestRate` divided by 12; 
this interest should be added to savingsBalance

Provide a `static` member function `modifyInterestRate` that sets the `static`
`annualInterestRate` to a new value. 

Write a driver program to test class `SavingsAccount`

Instantiate two different objects of class SavingsAccount , saver1 and saver2 , with balances of
$2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set the
`annualInterestRate` to 3 percent

Then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for each of the savers.
Then set the `annualInterestRate` to 4 percent,
calculate the next month’s interest and print the new balances for each of the savers */
