## Programming Assignment 
For *Programming Languages Course*

Please watch the assignment instruction video before working on this assignment. 

Given the grammar for a hypothetical imperative programming language,\
write a program that analyzes the syntax of input programs for the language.\
Your program should read an input test program from a file\
and then determine whether or not it contains any syntax errors\
The program does not have to show where the syntax error occurred\
or what kind of error it was. You can use any programming language you prefer to write the program.

In your program:

    Implement a lexical analyzer as a subprogram of your program. 
    Each time the lexical analyzer is called, it should return the next lexeme and its token code.
    Implement a parser based on the following EBNF rules. 
    Create a subprogram for each non-terminal symbol which should parse only sentences that can be generated by the non-terminal.

```ebnf
<program>               -> program begin <statement_list> end
<statement_list>        -> <statement> {;<statement>}
<statement>             -> <assignment_statement> | <if_statement> | <loop_statement>
<assignment_statement>  -> <variable> = <expression>
<variable>              -> identifier (An identifier is a string that begins with a letter followed by 0 or more letters and/or digits)
<expression>            -> <term> { (+|-) <term>}
<term>                  -> <factor> {(* | /) <factor> }
<factor>                -> identifier | int_constant | (<expr>)
<if_statement>          -> if (<logic_expression>) then <statement>
<logic_expression>      -> <variable> (< | >) <variable> (Assume that logic expressions have only less than or greater than operators)
<loop_statement>        -> loop (<logic_expression>) <statement>
```

Upload the following:

1. All your source code

2. Screen dumps of the execution of your program\
   The file below contains 6 input program examples which you need to use to test your parser\
   Run your parser using every input program\
   In each screen dump, show the input test file (containing one input program example) and the output generated by your parser\
   <font color="red">If you do not upload the screen dumps, your assignment will be considered incomplete and marks will be deducted</font>
